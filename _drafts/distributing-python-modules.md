Sometimes you write or (more likely to be my case) modify python modules to suit your needs. If these modifications are crucial in a particular pipeline that you want others to reproduce (like in a research paper) you have to share your code. Moreover, if you use those modules over and over again, but you don't want to distribute them through PiPy, it might be an idea to pack them for distribution over GitHub.

I learnt to do that. I am collecting here some notes for future reference.
